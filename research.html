								<h3>Current Research at OSU</h3>
								<p>I am currently working with Professor Ji Wang on a project that involves simulating observations of biosignatures on
								Super Earths with the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope<p>


								<hr />

								<h4>Master's Thesis at UT Austin</h4>
								<p> At the University of Texas at Austin I worked with Dr. Brendan Bowler on a project
								characterizing a low-mass companion in the Beta Pictoris Moving Group<p>
								<hr />
								<h4>Undergraduate Research at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock</h4>
								<p> As an undergraduate, I worked with Professor Tony Hall on a research project 
								involving the classification and identification of known meteorite samples. Meteorties provide insight into the initial conditions and elements present during the formation of the Solar System .
								 The motivation for this project
								was to understand basic spectroscopic properties of stony meteorites to assist the  small Physics & Astronomy department with determining the nature of unknown samples from the public.  
								 This project focused on stony meteorites; they are the most common type of meteorite, 
								 but not the most common found. This is due to weathering which  can alter their appearance, which makes them resemble Earth rocks.
								
								<div>
								I compared unknown rock samples with known stony 
								meteorties and analyzed their composition with a Raman spectrometer.
								 A Raman Spectrometer utilizes raman spectroscopy, a type of vibrational spectroscopy that uses the vibrational energies associated with bonds 
								 in a sample to analyze the unique fingerprint that mineral structure have.
								 
								 I also worked with the 
								geology department to make thin sections of samples for use with a petrographic microscope, and I also utilized Nickel tests for samples <p>
